# jspmm

JSpMM provides matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication for different matrix types and different backends 
like Multicore CPU, OpenCL and GridComputing based on GridGain in single precision floating point arithmetic.

The package support current matrix types:

* Dense
* Compressed Column Storage [(CCS/CSC)](http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node92.html)
* Coordinate Storage Format [(COO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Coordinate_list_.28COO.29)
* Compressed Row Storage [(CRS/CSR)](http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node91.html)
* Mutable COO
* Dense vector

Supported multiplication between the different matrix types are:

* (Dense, CCS, CRS, COO matrix) x (dense vector)
* (Dense matrix) x (CCS Matrix)
* (CRS matrix) x (CCS matrix) also COO result matrix
* more coming...

The (CRS matrix) x (CCS matrix) multiplication take ideas from the paper of [Sean Rose, GPU Sparse Matrix Multiplication with CUDA, 2013](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/research/projects/rose_report.pdf)

## Examples

Create matrices:
```java
// 5x5 matrix
static final float[] m0 = new float[]{
        0, 0, 3, 1, 0,
        2, 0, 0, 4, 0,
        0, 0, 2, 0, 0,
        0, 3, 0, 1, 0,
        4, 0, 2, 0, 3
    };

// dense matrix with 5 col and 5 row
DenseMatrix dense = new DenseMatrix(5, 5);

// create dense matrix from values
DenseMatrix dense = DenseMatrix.create(m0, 5);

// create CRS matrix from values, 0 elements will not be stored (sparse)
CRSMatrix crs = CRSMatrix.create(m0, 5);

// create CCS matrix from values, 0 elements will not be stored (sparse)
CCSMatrix ccs = CCSMatrix.create(m0, 5);

```

Multiply matrices (CPU):

```java
// multiply dense x dense matrix (single threaded)
dense0.multiply(dense0);

// multiply CRS x CCS matrix (single threaded) with result as COO matrix
MutableCOOMatrix coo = crs.multiply(ccs, MutableCOOMatrix.class);

// create SpMM context with default threaded executor
SpMM context = SpMM.create();

// concurrent CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result
MutableCOOMatrix coo = context.multiply(crs, ccs);

```

Multiply matrices (OpenCL):

```java
// create OpenCL context with best device (GPU)
CL cl = CL.create();

// dense x dense matrix multiplication on the GPU
DenseFloatMatrix dense = cl.multiply(dense0, dense1);

// CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result on the GPU
COOMatrix coo = cl.multiply(crs, ccs);

```

Multiply matrices on the GridGain cluster:

```java
// start or connect to your grid, for example
GridEntry grid = GridEntry.start();

// create SpMM context with the ExecutorService from the compute grid
SpMM context = SpMM.create(grid.getGrid().compute().executorService());

// dense x dense matrix multiplication on the GPU
DenseFloatMatrix dense = cl.multiply(dense0, dense1);

// CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result on the compute grid
MutableCOOMatrix coo = spmm.multiply(crs, ccs);

```

## Note

Please note that the package is experimental and the API can change in the future.
