# JSpMM - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cxplonka/jspmm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cxplonka/jspmm)

JSpMM provides matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication for different matrix types and different backends 
for Java8 Streams, Multicore CPU, OpenCL and GridComputing based on GridGain in single precision floating point arithmetic.

The package support current matrix types:

* Dense
* Compressed Column Storage [(CCS/CSC)](http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node92.html)
* Coordinate Storage Format [(COO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Coordinate_list_.28COO.29)
* Compressed Row Storage [(CRS/CSR)](http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node91.html)
* Mutable COO
* Dense vector

Supported multiplication between the different matrix types are:

* (Dense, CCS, CRS, COO matrix) x (dense vector)
* (Dense matrix) x (Dense Matrix)
* (CRS matrix) x (CCS matrix) as COO result matrix
* more coming...

The (CRS matrix) x (CCS matrix) multiplication take ideas from the paper of [Sean Rose, GPU Sparse Matrix Multiplication with CUDA, 2013](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/research/projects/rose_report.pdf)

## Examples

Create matrices:
```java
// 5x5 matrix
static final float[] m0 = new float[]{
        0, 0, 3, 1, 0,
        2, 0, 0, 4, 0,
        0, 0, 2, 0, 0,
        0, 3, 0, 1, 0,
        4, 0, 2, 0, 3
    };

// dense matrix with 5 col and 5 row
DenseMatrix dense = new DenseMatrix(5, 5);

// create dense matrix from values
DenseMatrix dense = DenseMatrix.create(m0, 5);

// create CRS matrix from values, 0 elements will not be stored (sparse)
CRSMatrix crs = CRSMatrix.create(m0, 5);

// create CCS matrix from values, 0 elements will not be stored (sparse)
CCSMatrix ccs = CCSMatrix.create(m0, 5);

```

#### Multiply matrices (CPU):

```java
// create context, new StreamSpMM() for Java8 parallel Stream API implementation
SpMM spmm = new SingleSpMM();

// multiply dense x dense matrix (single threaded)
DenseFloatMatrix result = spmm.multiply(m0, m1, DenseFloatMatrix.class);

// multiply CRS x CCS matrix (single threaded) with result as COO matrix
MutableCOOMatrix coo = spmm.multiply(crs, ccs, MutableCOOMatrix.class);

// create SpMM context with default threaded executor
SpMM context = ExeceutorSpMM.create(); // localy better to use Stream implementation

// concurrent CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result
MutableCOOMatrix coo = context.multiply(crs, ccs);

```

#### Multiply matrices (OpenCL):

```java
// create OpenCL context with best device (GPU)
SpMM cl = CLSpMM.create();

// dense x dense matrix multiplication on the GPU
DenseFloatMatrix result = spmm.multiply(m0, m1, DenseFloatMatrix.class);

// CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result on the GPU
MutableCOOMatrix coo = context.multiply(crs, ccs);

```

#### Multiply matrices on the GridGain cluster:

```java
// start or connect to your grid, for example
GridEntry grid = GridEntry.start();

// create SpMM context with the ExecutorService from the compute grid
SpMM context = ExeceutorSpMM.create(grid.getGrid().compute().executorService());

// CRS x CCS matrix with COO matrix as result on the compute grid
MutableCOOMatrix coo = spmm.multiply(crs, ccs, MutableCOOMatrix);

```

Please note that the package is experimental and the API can change in the future.
